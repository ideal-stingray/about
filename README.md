# about
if you see me using carrd or linktree i've been replaced by an impostor; this is the alternative.

call me sphere: mid-20s, they/them pronouns, Professional Robot Torturer.  queering the filthy techbro/virtuous fandom contributor binary.  i was born with the gift of hands & i'm going to make that everyone else's problem.  living in california with 2 housemates and a double-digit number of variously haunted computers.

* naruto meta
* naruto fic, mostly set in my [Hinataverse AU](https://archiveofourown.org/series/2600881) -- you don't need to know much, if anything, about naruto to read this; after a decade plus of croisoning in my brain stew it's only loosely attached to "canon", so it's equally incomprehensible either way
* possibly someday, eventually, there will be some scum villain fic

tumblr (main): [gender-trash](https://gender-trash.tumblr.com)
* personal blogging
* programming/roboticsposting
* bookbinding, sewing machine restoration, knitting, and other craft/maker projects When You Least Expect It
* reblog-heavy; category tags idiosyncratic and many reblogs are untagged

tumblr (danmei sideblog): [mu-qingfang-stan-account](https://mu-qingfang-stan-account.tumblr.com)
* svsss main; includes mxtx, 2ha/yuwu, devil venerable, misvil, and Other Small Fandoms of danmei novels i wish more people would read
* reblog-heavy
* i will attempt to tag spoilers (for english-licensed novels) for content that the official english releases haven't gotten to, but i will probably forget. sorry
* however, i've committed to maintaining a consistent category tag for each cnovel/fandom, so blacklist at will

tumblr (naruto/fic sideblog): [trans-girl-uchiha-itachi](https://trans-girl-uchiha-itachi.tumblr.com)
* mostly original posts about my nart fic and about research i am doing for my nart fic
* reblog-light and generally low-traffic
* naruto reblogs not related to my fic or to itachi will still go on gender-trash
